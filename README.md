# LISPY

A LISP interpreter which is being written in C. I am following [Build Your Own LISP](https://buildyourownlisp.com/) book to build this project.

## Running this on your machine
First, make sure you have `gcc` installed on your machine.

```sh
$ gcc --version
```

The above command should print `gcc` version.

1. Clone the repo
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/prashantacharya/lispy-c.git
  ```

2. Build the project
  ```sh
  make build
  ```

3. Run the project
  ```sh
  make run
  ```

> NOTE: THE PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND WILL HAVE MASSIVE CHANGE.
